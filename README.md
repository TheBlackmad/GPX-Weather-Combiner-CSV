# GPX-Weather-Combiner-CSV
Python program that creates a CSV with combined data from GPX workout and weather data
This example program is formed of two files:
1. the main.py that reads a file GPX and completes the location information with weather information from Weatherbit.io.
2. the test4.gpx file that serves as the input to the main.py program. This file is input to the main.py through a global variable in the python file.

To make this program work, you will need to change your key for using the web service from Weatherbit.io and to replace the filename.

The output of this program is the GPX file with weather data as CSV File for future analysis.
